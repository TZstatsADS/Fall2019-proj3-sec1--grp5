**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. 

Ting Cai developed the SVM model and tuned the hyperparameters of the model. She also made comparisons between models.

Yicheng Li built the baseline XGBoost and LightGBM models and developed CNN and Neural Network models. He also tuned hyperparameters in the Neural Network model.

Weunyue We built the baseline GBM model and the XGBoost model. He also tuned the hyperparameters of the model. He is also the presenter of the project.

Kangkang Zhang developed the Feature Extraction algorithm and worked on the SVM model. She also tuned the hyperparameters of the SVM model.

Na Zhuo developed the Random Forest model and tuned the hyperparameters of this model. She also tried the baseline model on R.
